We must grow stronger because of the power of the beings we will face in battle. The path we have chosen demands that we become legends.

GodsVsMe is a terminal-based, story-driven soulslike game. Because it is terminal-based, it does not feature graphics or visual elements. At the beginning of the game, you choose one of three races and try to complete the game by utilizing the advantages provided by the race you select. To finish the game, you must progress through the story and defeat five bosses.

The game is still under development, but since the core mechanics are complete, I believe I will be able to finish it more quickly. GodsVsMe is a project I created solely to improve myself.
